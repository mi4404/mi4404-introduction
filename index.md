### Introduction

I'm from Alabama and I used to go to an art school with a dormitory called the Alabama School of Fine Arts. There, I majored in Math/Science so I wasn't really an art student but I took a bunch of cool art classes. 

A couple of my hobbies include:
- Filming
- Embroidery
- Cooking
- Watching cool videos

I love listening to music and finding new artists. Though I don't have a single favorite artist, I have a couple artists I've been listening to constantly over the week. 
These include: 
- Low Hum
- S+C+A+R+R
- 53 Thieves 
- Jamie xx
- Flume
- Droeloe 

I don't play many games because I'm on MacOS and it can be hard to find games for it. But the one game I used to play a lot is League of Legends because it could run pretty well on my old MacBook Air. Though nowadays, I don't play as often and I exclusively play with friends. 

### Favorite Food

This is an image of one of my favorite foods. It's an image of chicken paratha with a side of raita!
